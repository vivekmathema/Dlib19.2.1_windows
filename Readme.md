Dlib has always been difficult to install using pip3 and using anaconda is always not the best option when you have installed or portable python.
Dlib 19.21.0  pre-compiled wheel for windows (windows 10)
(tested on both portable and installed python 3.7 32 and 64 bit ) works perfect...


Installation is super easy:
downlaod the .whl file and install using
**  command prompt>  pip3  install  dlib-19.21.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl  **
